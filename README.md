# CaloricDensityCalculator
This is a a web application that calculates the caloric density of different foods for the Noom Weightloss App. I built it because sometimes the information in the Noom database is not accurate and I wanted to be able to quickly calculate the color of my food.  

Caloric density is calculated as calories/serving size (ml or grams). Noom assigns different colors depending on the caloric density and the type of food (solid, soup or liquid) and some other factors. I used the Noom formula and color system (https://web.noom.com/support/2016/08/think-food-color-wrong/) to build the app.

It is fully responsive to different screen sizes and was built using Object Orientent Programming.

Technologies used: Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
